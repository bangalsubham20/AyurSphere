        // Predefined remedies data
        const remediesData = {
            "Headache": "Headaches can be caused by a variety of factors, such as stress, dehydration, or lack of sleep. To relieve a headache, drink ginger tea, which contains natural anti-inflammatory properties that can help reduce headache pain. Rest in a quiet, dark room and try applying a cold or warm compress to your forehead or neck. Drinking plenty of water to stay hydrated is also essential.",
            "Stomachache": "Stomachaches may be due to indigestion, stress, or an underlying health condition. To relieve a stomachache, boil a handful of mint leaves in water and drink the infusion after it cools. Mint has soothing properties that help reduce stomach discomfort. Additionally, avoid heavy meals or spicy food and ensure you get adequate rest to allow your body to recover.",
            "Cough": "Coughing can be caused by viral infections, allergies, or irritation in the throat. To soothe a persistent cough, mix honey with fresh ginger juice. Honey has antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties, while ginger helps reduce throat irritation. Drinking warm fluids, such as tea or broth, can help ease coughing and prevent dehydration.",
            "Fever": "Fever is a common symptom of an infection, indicating that the body is fighting off illness. To manage a fever, boil a few basil leaves in water and drink the resulting herbal infusion. Basil is known for its antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects. Ensure plenty of rest, hydrate, and avoid heavy clothing to prevent overheating. If the fever persists, seek medical attention.",
            "Sore Throat": "A sore throat is often caused by a viral infection, allergies, or dry air. Gargling with warm saltwater can help reduce inflammation and kill bacteria, providing temporary relief. You can also try consuming warm liquids, such as herbal tea or broths, and using throat lozenges to keep your throat moist.",
            "Indigestion": "Indigestion often occurs after eating heavy or spicy foods and is characterized by discomfort or a bloated feeling. To alleviate indigestion, drink a cup of peppermint tea after meals. Peppermint has properties that relax the gastrointestinal muscles, which can reduce discomfort. Additionally, eating smaller meals, chewing food slowly, and avoiding carbonated drinks can help prevent indigestion.",
            "Diarrhea": "Diarrhea may be caused by infections, food intolerances, or digestive issues. To manage diarrhea, consume foods like boiled rice and ripe bananas, which are easy on the stomach and can help firm up stools. Drink plenty of fluids, such as oral rehydration solutions, to replenish lost fluids and electrolytes. Avoid fatty or spicy foods until symptoms subside.",
            "Nausea": "Nausea is often a symptom of stomach upset, motion sickness, or anxiety. Chewing on fennel seeds or ginger slices can help calm the stomach and reduce nausea. Ginger has long been used for its anti-nausea properties, and fennel aids digestion. Additionally, sipping on clear fluids like ginger ale or peppermint tea can help settle your stomach and keep you hydrated.",
            "Insomnia": "Insomnia, or difficulty falling and staying asleep, can be triggered by stress, anxiety, or poor sleep hygiene. To improve sleep, practice relaxation techniques such as deep breathing exercises, progressive muscle relaxation, and meditation. Maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, avoiding caffeine and heavy meals before bed, and creating a calm, dark environment can also help improve sleep quality.",
            "Anxiety": "Anxiety can be managed through lifestyle changes and various relaxation techniques. Deep breathing exercises, mindfulness meditation, and progressive muscle relaxation can reduce anxiety symptoms. Regular physical activity and maintaining a healthy diet can also have a positive impact on mental health. Identifying sources of stress and seeking therapy may also be beneficial in managing anxiety long-term.",
            "Common Cold": "The common cold is a viral infection of the upper respiratory tract, causing symptoms like congestion, cough, and sore throat. Stay hydrated by drinking warm fluids such as herbal tea, chicken soup, or broths. Rest is essential to allow your body to recover. Over-the-counter cold medications can help alleviate symptoms like congestion and body aches. Wash your hands frequently to prevent the spread of the virus.",
            "Allergies": "Allergy symptoms, such as sneezing, itching, and nasal congestion, are triggered by allergens like pollen, dust mites, or pet dander. To alleviate symptoms, avoid known allergens whenever possible. Over-the-counter antihistamines can help relieve sneezing, itching, and runny nose. Nasal sprays and decongestants can reduce nasal congestion, but consult a healthcare professional before using them regularly.",
            "Sinusitis": "Sinusitis is an inflammation of the sinuses that can cause facial pain, pressure, and nasal congestion. Using a saline nasal spray can help relieve congestion and clear mucus from the sinuses. Warm compresses applied to the face can also help alleviate pain and pressure. Staying hydrated, using a humidifier, and avoiding irritants like cigarette smoke can help manage sinusitis symptoms.",
            "Asthma": "Asthma is a chronic respiratory condition that causes difficulty breathing, often triggered by allergens, cold air, or exercise. Managing asthma typically involves using an inhaler or other prescribed medications to control inflammation and open airways. Avoiding triggers like smoke, strong odors, and allergens is crucial. Regular exercise and maintaining a healthy weight can also help improve lung function and reduce asthma symptoms.",
            "Arthritis": "Arthritis refers to inflammation in the joints, causing pain, stiffness, and reduced range of motion. To relieve arthritis pain, apply warm compresses to the affected joints. Gentle exercises, such as swimming or yoga, can improve joint flexibility and reduce pain. Anti-inflammatory medications, physical therapy, and maintaining a healthy weight can also help manage symptoms.",
            "Back Pain": "Back pain can be caused by muscle strain, poor posture, or underlying conditions like arthritis. For relief, alternate between applying ice and heat to the affected area. Ice helps reduce inflammation, while heat promotes blood flow and relaxes muscles. Stretching, strengthening exercises, and proper posture can also help alleviate back pain and prevent future flare-ups.",
            "Migraine": "Migraines are severe headaches often accompanied by nausea, sensitivity to light, and aura. To manage a migraine, apply a cold compress to your forehead or the back of your neck. Rest in a quiet, dark room to minimize light and sound sensitivity. Over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or aspirin can help reduce pain, but prescription medications may be needed for frequent or severe migraines.",
            "Heartburn": "Heartburn occurs when stomach acid backs up into the esophagus, causing a burning sensation. To manage heartburn, avoid trigger foods such as spicy, fatty, and acidic items. Elevating the head of your bed while sleeping can help prevent acid reflux at night. Over-the-counter antacids or acid-reducing medications can provide temporary relief. If heartburn persists, consult a doctor for further treatment options.",
            "Hiccups": "Hiccups are involuntary contractions of the diaphragm that can be caused by eating or drinking too quickly, stress, or irritation. To stop hiccups, try drinking a glass of cold water slowly, holding your breath for a few seconds, or breathing into a paper bag. Staying calm and relaxed can also help prevent and stop hiccups.",
            "Constipation": "Constipation is characterized by infrequent or difficult bowel movements. To alleviate constipation, increase your fiber intake by consuming fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Drinking plenty of water helps soften stools, while regular physical activity promotes healthy bowel movements. Consider a fiber supplement if necessary, and avoid excessive use of laxatives.",
            "High Blood Pressure": "High blood pressure, or hypertension, can lead to serious health issues if not managed. To control blood pressure, reduce your salt intake, eat a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, and engage in regular physical activity. Techniques like yoga, meditation, and deep breathing exercises can also help reduce stress, which can contribute to high blood pressure.",
            "Acne": "Acne occurs when hair follicles become clogged with oil and dead skin cells. To prevent acne, cleanse your skin gently with a mild, non-comedogenic cleanser. Avoid touching your face to prevent the spread of bacteria. Over-the-counter topical treatments like benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid can help reduce acne. If acne is severe, consult a dermatologist for prescription treatments.",
            "Eczema": "Eczema is a skin condition characterized by itchy, inflamed skin. To manage eczema, moisturize your skin regularly with fragrance-free, hypoallergenic products. Avoid triggers like harsh soaps and irritants. Topical corticosteroids can help manage flare-ups. Wear soft, breathable fabrics to minimize skin irritation, and keep your environment humidified to prevent dryness.",
            "Rash": "A rash can be caused by an allergic reaction, infection, or skin irritation. To relieve a rash, apply calamine lotion or hydrocortisone cream to soothe itching and inflammation. Avoid scratching the rash, as it can worsen the condition. If the rash persists or is accompanied by other symptoms like fever, consult a healthcare provider.",
            "Stress": "Stress is a natural response to challenges, but chronic stress can affect your physical and mental health. To manage stress, engage in relaxation techniques like yoga, meditation, and deep breathing exercises. Regular physical activity, a balanced diet, and maintaining a strong support system can also help reduce stress levels. Learning to manage stress effectively can improve your overall well-being.",
            "Depression": "Depression is a mood disorder characterized by persistent sadness, hopelessness, and a lack of interest in activities. Seeking therapy and support from loved ones is essential in managing depression. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment option, and in some cases, medication prescribed by a psychiatrist may be necessary to restore chemical balance in the brain.",
            "Obesity": "Obesity is characterized by excess body fat, which can increase the risk of several health conditions. To manage obesity, focus on portion control, reduce calorie intake, and increase physical activity. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise per week, such as walking or swimming. Working with a healthcare provider or nutritionist can help create a sustainable weight loss plan.",
            "Osteoporosis": "Osteoporosis is a condition where bones become weak and brittle, increasing the risk of fractures. To support bone health, consume calcium and vitamin D-rich foods like dairy products and leafy greens. Weight-bearing exercises such as walking, jogging, or weightlifting help maintain bone density. Avoid smoking and excessive alcohol intake, as they can weaken bones.",
